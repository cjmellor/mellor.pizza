## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris. I'm a Full Stack Developer and currently living in Leeds in the U.K. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

I have been developing websites for a while now. I remember using WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver (now Adobe). 'Member Geocities? But then I started to be able to read the code, and drag-and-drop tools became a thing of the past.

I'm a big wrestling fan -- have been for 30+ years now (bah gawd) and used to make a lot of websites catered around that. It was fun, I learnt a ton about code and what it was to own a community.

Around 2011/12, I felt PHP wasn't going anywhere and other newer frameworks kept popping up and piqued my interest -- Ruby on Rails for example and I nearly jumped onto that boat, but then Laravel came along and changed the game. I've pretty much followed Laravel since it started getting it's traction, around version 3 I believe and I certainly don't regret it, it's been a joy to use and follow the community and see the capabilities of what people have been able to do with it.

It took a while, but I eventually got into the commercial side of this and was able to start doing this as a job. I'd been doing some development work in other roles, but nothing official. Overtime, I also picked up some DevOps skills and became sufficient in using these skills in other roles.
